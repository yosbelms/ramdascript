# RamdaScript

RamdaScript is a language that compiles to JavaScript. It is a syntactic sugar to make elegant what is already straightforward, the Ramda API.

## Overview

RamdaScript was created after trying to write apps logic using only Ramda. I quickly realized that the Lisp syntax fits better than JavaScript when writing large codebase using a declarative approach. Furthemore, it is always tempting to fall in writing imperative snippets, and finally end up with a mixing of different paradigms.

RamdaScript compiles to readable and pretty-printed JavaScript. The following RamdaScript code:

```
(def todos [
    {
        : title 'See todo list'
        : completed false
    }
    {
        : title 'Procrastinate'
        : completed true
    }])

(def findCompleted
    (filter
        (propEq 'completed' true)))

(console.log (findCompleted todos))
```

Compiles to:

```
var todos = [
    {
        title : 'See todo list',
        completed : false
    },
    {
        title : 'Procrastinate',
        completed : true
    }
]

var findCompleted = R.filter(
    R.propEq('completed', true))

console.log(
    findCompleted(todos))
```

## Installation

To install, first make sure you have a working copy of the latest stable version of Node.js. You can then install RamdaScript globally with [npm](https://npmjs.org):

```shell
npm install -g ramdascript
```

If you need RamdaScript as a dependency, install it locally:

```shell
npm install --save ramdascript
```

If you want to run RamdaScript code in the browser for rapid prototyping, include it in a web page using the `script` tag. The generated JavaScript depends on Ramda.

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="node_modules/ramda/dist/ramda.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="node_modules/ramdascript/browser.js"></script>
```

Once the document has been loaded RamdaScript will run the source code contained in the `script` elements with `type='text/ramdascript'`. Example:

```
<script type="text/ramdascript">
    (console.log 'Hello Functional')
</script>
```

## Usage

Once installed, you should have access to the `ram` command, which can compile `.ram` files to `.js`, and provide an interactive REPL. The `ram` CLI takes the following subcommands:

```
Usage: ram [command] [args]

If "command" is a .ram file will run that file
If called without any command will print this help

run [-src]

Run .ram file containig RamdaScript code
  -src    Route to source file with RamdaScript code

compile [-src] [-dst] [-format]

Compile to JavaScript and save as .js file
  -src    Route to source file or directory with RamdaScript code
          the default value is the current directory (cwd)
  -dst    Route where the resulting JavaScript code will be saved
          if route is "stdout" the resulting code will be sent to stdout
  -format Specify module format, possible values are: cjs, iife, none;
          cjs is the default

eval [-src]

Compile and print RamdaScript code directly from the command line
  -src    RamdaScript source code to be executed
          if -src is stdin the code will be readed from stdin

repl

Launch an interactive RamdaScript session

help

Print this help
```

Executing `ram` without any command is the same as `ram help`

Examples :

Compile a script

```shell
ram compile -src path/to/script.ram
```

Recursively compile `.ram` files contained inside a directory

```shell
ram compile -src path/to/dir -dst path/to/destiny
```

Run a `.ram` file

```shell
ram run -src path/to/script.ram
```

Alternatively

```shell
ram path/to/script.ram
```

Run a short RamdaScript snippet

```shell
ram eval -src "(console.log (map (add 1) [1 2 3]))"
```

> Compiled RamdaScript code directly depends on Ramda, so, Ramda installation is a requirement to run generated code.

## Language Reference

RamdaScript uses a S-Expression based syntax made popular by the Lisp family. In RamdaScript elements are separated by spaces, although commas (`,`) are optional. It has few builtin functions apart from the rich set that [Ramda API](http://ramdajs.com/docs/) provides, these are:

- `new`
- `def`
- `fn`
- `alter`
- `import`
- `export`

Ramda functions are very well documented [here](http://ramdajs.com/docs/)

### Literals and Comments

RamdaScript shares `Boolean` and `Number` syntaxes with JavaScript, `Strings` are delimited by single quotes (`'`) and can be multilined, the `nil` keyword is the equivalen to JavaScript `null`. The underscore (`_`) symbol is the equivalent to the Ramda special placeholder.

String

```
'John Doe'
```

Multilined String
```
'Hello
World'
```

Number

```
1
.5
0.3
1e9
```

Regular Expression

```
/abc[xy]*(capture)?/g
```

Boolean

```
true
false
```

Null value

```
nil
```

Key Identifier

```
:keyIdent
```

Array

```
[1 2 3]
```

Object

```
{:name 'John' :age 30}
```

S-Expression

```
(a b c)
```

Special placeholder(`_`), detailed description [here](http://ramdajs.com/docs/index.html#__)

```
((subtract _ 8) 10)
```

Single line comment

```
// this is a comment
```

Multiline comment

```
/*
this is
a comment
*/
```

Optional commas, can be used to separate elements inside S-Expression, Array items, and Object properties.

```
(a, b, c)
[1, 2, 3]
{:a 1, :b 2}
```

### Functions

RamdaScript imports all Ramda functions, although it provides a few builtin for better interoperability with JavaScript

#### New

Returns an instance of a class.

```
(new Todo 'Download a Forex App')
```

#### Def

Declares a variable and assigns a value to it.

```
(def counter 0)
```

#### Fn

Returns a lamda function. All functions defined with RamdaScript are curried.

```
(fn [args...] exprs...)
```

The first parameter is a list of arguments, followed by one or more expressions. Once executed it will evaluate every expression in the same order as providaded and returns the result of evaluate the last expression.

```
(def four
    (fn [] 1 2 3 4)

(console.log (four))

// 4
```

#### Alter

Modifies and returns the value of a variable. This function can be partially applied.

```
(alter app.state newState)

// partial application
((alter app.state) newState)
```


#### Import

Imports external modules

```
(import 'react' React)
```

```
(import 'sanctuary' [Maybe, Just, Nothing])
```

#### Export

Exports from a module

```
(export [func1 func2])
```

export as default

```
(export exportedAsDefault)
```

#### More functions

Ramda documentation http://ramdajs.com/docs/

### Embedded JavaScript

Hopefully, you will never need to use it, but if you ever need to appeal for JavaScript snippets into your RamdaScript code, you can use `{#` `#}` wrappers.

```
(filter {# n => n % 2 == 0 #} [1 2 3 4])
```

```
{# var even = n => n % 2 == 0 #}

(filter even [1 2 3 4])
```

The source code contained between these wrappers will pass through compilation process.
